- 👋 Hi, I’m @Retired-Programming
- 👀 I’m interested in relearning/learning to program specifically a local personal financil software package to manage my accounts, overall budget, and cashflow. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning visual basic but am transitioning to C# due to the seemingly limited support for VB.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate I thinkk but the whole process is new to me.
- 📫 I can always be reached via email at Willis_Kevin@Hotmail.com

My current project is expecting to migrate data out of Quicken into an MS-Access backend database with a C# front end.  
My motivation is to keep my financial data all local to my PC and out of the Cloud.  The currently available personal 
software packages are cloud base which is a security risk I'm trying to avoid.
